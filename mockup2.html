            <p style="line-height: 2;"> Hi! My Name is Jaden Cousin! </p>
            <p style="line-height: 2;">I'm the oldest of 6 and have two beautiful dogs. I grew up in Oak Park Illinois and have been into games ever since I was 5. My mom introduced me to them one day. She sat me down and played the original Donkey Kong with me. From that moment in time I fell in love with them! I wanted to play them more and explore what the virtual word seperate from ours was like. I grew up with games such as Super Mario, Sonic The Hedgehog and Kirby. I like to believe those games had a really positive impact on the way I act and treat others. They inspired me so much that I even tried to write stories of my own.</p>
            <p style="line-height: 2;">I go to Illinois State University as a Video Game Design Major. I also recently have participated in events such as the research sympnosis. With my poster of the famous engineer Gerald Lawson!</p>
